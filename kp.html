<p>Aravind K. P. grew up in Udupi which is known for its iconic race 'Kambla'. When he was 16, a supercross he watched his first supercross event in Manipal and secretly thought of racing as his career. But he did not have a bike and when approached, his father Prabhakar, put forth a condition stating that he would get a bike only if he scores 80% in his 12th board exams. Aravind scored 84.7% in his exams and got his bike. At the age of 19, he started racing after a local mechanic suggested that he ride on the race track. He started as a privateer in local events, many of which he took part without the knowledge of his parents. As a student, he did not have much money to spend on racing and his friends used to support him. One day, his father woke up and saw his photo in the newspaper after he won the 'Raymond's classic' race in Mangalore. Initially his parents did not like him racing but later supported him. Aravind is also a National level swimmer, a state level skater and was also active in track and fields events.</p>
